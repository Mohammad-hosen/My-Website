      How hard building a <span><a href="#website">website</a></span> is?<br><br>
      Well, it depends, actually. <span><a href="#why">Why?</a></span><br>
      There is a lot of <span><a href="#simple-website">simple website</a></span> out there at internet. But you can't actually choose such a website for your business purpose, even for personal blog too.<br><br>
      And, again, there are a lot of high qualitiful and <span><a href="#stylish-website">stylish website</a></span> at internet. But you shouldn't use those. Cause, because of so styling element the web site will take <span>too long to load.</span> Ofcousre, this is boring for user.<br><br>
      To know <span><a href="#what-to-do">what's to do and what's not</a></span> keep scrolling this page to the end. Any complain about page? Feel free to <span><a href="#contact">contact</a></span> me.<br>

      <h1 class="h1">What is website?</h1>
      <p>In order to know what website is, it is necessary, first, to know what web is <span style="color:#3D4E5E">webpage</span><br><br>
      Accroding to <span><a style="color:#3D4E5E" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page" target="_blank">wikipedia</a></span>,</p>
      <blockquote>
        A web page (or webpage) is a hypertext document provided by a website and displayed to a user in a web browser.
      </blockquote>
      <p>And typically,</p>
      <blockquote>
      A website is a group of webpages hosting on a server and browsable from any browser (and tecnically, from anywhere) being connected with internet.
      </blockquote>
      <p>A website typically consists of many web pages linked together in a coherent fashion. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.<br><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#3D4E5E">And here, we can consider the book as a website.</span>

    <div class="color12" id="simple-website">
      <h1 class="h2">Simple Website</h1>
      <p class="p1">
        A typical website may contains <abbr title="Hyper Text MarkUp Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr>, and <abbr title="javascript">js</abbr>. Actually, A simple website have such file as a stylish and complex website have. But the difference is, it doesn't need a lot more complex tag and command.<br><br>
        For example, you will find a bunch of website which doesn't focus so much on their website style. They just concern about their content.<br><br>
        Well, they don't totally ignore the styling. But simplify it as possible as they can. Cause, probably, it's save their time and may be money too.
        <br><br>
       <span> A simple website contains more simple tag than the others.</span></p>
       <p class="p1"><span style="color:#874E75">Lets look into 3 fundamental language of building up a simple (actually a overall) website:</span></p>
       <h2>HTML</h2>
       <img src="html.png" alt="html" width="70">
       <p class="p1">
         The basic fundamental of website (actually, I should say front end) is HTML.<br>
         The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
          <br><br>
        HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.<br><br>
        Simple website is used some basic html tag like &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;,  &lt;title&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1-h6&gt;, &lt;span&gt;  &lt;emp&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; etc.
       </p>
       <h2>CSS</h2>
       <img src="css.png" alt="css" width="70">
       <p class="p1">
         Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br><br>
         CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, the size of the fonts, making text bigger, applying heading, adding stylish elements and so on.<br><br>
         <span>The basic syntax of css is <span style="color:#874E75">selector</span>{<span style="color:darkblue">property</span>:<span style="color:brown">value</span>;}</span>
       </p>
       <h2>JS</h2>
       <img src="javascript.png" alt="javascript" width="70">
       <p class="p1">
         JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.<br><br>
         You can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third (the two others is HTML and CSS) layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.

      <h1 class="h4">Why it is hard?</h1>
      <p class="p3">
        Why making a standard website is harder than it seems?<br><br>
        previously on, we demonstrate the definition of website. Hence, itbwas described that a website is consist of, may be, hundreds of webpages, even more.<br>
        So, making a lot of webpage isn't easy enough. And, well, making webpages isn't sufficient enough to publish the site. After making a website, one needs to register one's website to the WWW (World Wide Web).<br><br>
        He should buy a domain, link his page to that domain abd finally publish the page. Then people can browse his page through the internet.<br><br>
        You mighf wonder why I'm demotivating you. and well, I shouldn't, but I am trying to show the reality. It preety muvh annyoining, but you can overcome this hardness with <span>hardwork.</span><br>
        People literally rhit on this word. But the truth is, this is the onoy way of making this easier and making things happen.<br><br>
        <span>So grab your resources, and start having your things done.</span>

    <img src="robot.jpg" alt="robot-with-laptop" width="335px" style="padding-top:40px;">
    <h1 class="h5">Do's &amp; Do not's</h1>
    <p class="p4">
      <h2>What's to do</h2>
       <h3>Build simple website</h3>
       <p class="p4">
         <span style="color:#393E46">A study by Google had two key findings:</span><br>
          1.Users will judge websites as beautiful or not within 1/<sub>50</sub> th to 1/<sub>20</sub> th of a second.<br>
          2.<span class="color:#393E46">Visually complex</span> websites are consistently rated as less beautiful than their simpler counterparts.<br>
          Moreover, <span style="color: #393E46">highly prototypical</span> sites—those with layouts commonly associated with sites of their category—that also had a simple website design were rated the most beautiful.<br><br>

          In other words, the study found that the simpler the design, the better.
       </p>
       <h3>Use less image and Video</h3>
       <p class="p4">
          A large image is going to take a long time to load up. If you’ve got a ton of large images on your website, you’re adding extra load time for every picture, which negatively impacts the user experience and your search engine rankings.<br><br>
          So don't Use so much image let alone larger image to your website.
       </p>
       <h3>Register a domain</h3>
       <p class="p4">
         Your domain name should reflect your products or services so that your customers can easily find your business through a search engine. Your customers may also expect your domain name to be similar to your business name.
          <br><br>
        Your domain name will also be used for your email address. While you can use a free email address such as hotmail, sending emails from a business address looks more professional.
       </p><br>
       
      <h2>What's not</h2>
        <h3>Music & video On Your Site</h3>
        <p class="p4">
          Don't add music if it isn't mandatory for your site.<br>
          This is one of those, “just because you can doesn’t mean you should.” If you choose to use music make sure that it doesn’t automatically start playing when the page loads and the user chooses to turn it on.<br><br>
          It is equally aplicable for the video too. This sort of stuff force the site to take more time to load.</p>
        <h3>Animated Gif’s</h3>
        <p class="p4">
          These things stopped being cool 15 years ago and look hideous on any site. Just don’t to it, ever, no possible exceptions. If you were even thinking of this go wash your brain out with chlorine and start over.
        </p>
        <h3>Resize the Users Browsers Window</h3>
        <p class="p4">
          It’s annoying to the user and forces them to use their computer in a way that they were not planning/expecting. <br>This is a big <span style="color:#393E46">no-no</span>, if you have to resize the users’ window to make your site look better redesign your site, no exceptions.
        </p>
        <h3>Click Here</h3>
        <p class="p4">
          This recommendation is just a general good practice and is an effort in getting people away from being lazy. When you create a link, do not use the phrase “click here” to get someone to click.<br>
          Why?<br>
          Because your link isn’t search engine friendly and “click here” is generally meaningless. It also, and most importantly, doesn’t tell the reader exactly what it is, it isn’t relevant and is totally relative.
